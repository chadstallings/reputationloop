Hello!

This is my coding project, I didn't use a MVC do to the instructions, now on a much larger project, a MVC would be appropiate. this is a simple one page application
that has a class in the application.
I wrote everything from scratch, all functions are in the class, and all css is on the page.
I custom wrote my pagnation, and css.

Thank you for asking this, as you are my first proposal I have done on Upwork, I would really appreciate feedback!
I started on this on 7-12-16 10:30am and ended roughly 3:30 pm.

Thank you again,
Chad Stallings
